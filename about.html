<h1>Car Rental System</h1>
<p> Rental car distribution. The system can measure vehicle usage and distribute the load equally throughout the fleet and avoid putting rundown  assets on the road. In case of any car problems, it automatically assigns another available vehicle for the approved reservation. At the same time, monitoring the workload of each asset in the fleet, the system may set a reservation limit if the number of bookings is about to exceed the number of idling cars. </p>
